# Exercise 04: Configure AI Gateway using Azure API Management

## Scenario

In this exercise, you will configure Azure API Management as an AI Gateway to manage, secure, and optimize AI API traffic. You'll focus on implementing policies that enable token-based limiting, load balancing, authentication, and other critical gateway capabilities. This centralized approach allows you to control how AI services are accessed and consumed across your organization.

By leveraging Azure API Management policies, you'll implement governance controls that ensure responsible AI usage, prevent token overuse, and provide consistent security measures across all AI endpoints.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Configure Azure API Management policies for AI workloads
* Implement token-based rate limiting for AI services
* Set up load balancing across multiple AI backend endpoints
* Apply authentication and authorization policies
* Configure request and response transformations for AI APIs

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 45 minutes

> **Note:** This exercise focuses on policy configuration for the AI Gateway. Advanced topics such as observability (token usage metrics, monitoring, and analytics) and chargeback mechanisms will be covered in Exercise 05.
