# Task 02 - (Optional) Test with MCP Inspector

## Introduction

The MCP Inspector is a web-based tool that allows you to interactively test and debug MCP servers. In this task, you will use the MCP Inspector to connect to your running MCP server and test the available tools.

{: .warning }
> This task is **only valid for users running locally**. The MCP Inspector does not work with GitHub Codespaces due to network connectivity limitations. If you are using a Codespace, skip this task and proceed to Task 03.

## Description

You will install and launch the MCP Inspector, connect it to your running MCP Weather Mock server, and use it to test the `get_cities` and `get_weather` tools interactively.

## Success Criteria

- The MCP Inspector is running and connected to your MCP server.
- You can successfully call the `get_cities` and `get_weather` tools from the Inspector.

## Learning Resources

- [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Launch MCP Inspector

Open a **new terminal** (keep the MCP server running in the other terminal) and run:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

{: .note }
> If this is your first time running the command, you may be prompted to install the package. Type `y` to confirm.

The MCP Inspector will start and display a URL in the terminal, typically:

```
MCP Inspector is up and running at http://localhost:6274
```

Open this URL in your browser.

1. In the MCP Inspector web UI, change the **Transport Type** to **Streamable HTTP**.
2. In the **URL** field, enter:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/mcp
   ```

3. Click **Connect**.
4. You should see a successful connection status and the server information displayed.

</details>

### 03: Test the tools

Use the MCP Inspector to test the available tools.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

1. Click on the **Tools** tab in the Inspector.
2. You should see two tools listed: `get_cities` and `get_weather`.

**Test `get_cities`:**

1. Click on `get_cities`.
2. In the **Arguments** section, enter `thailand` for the `country` parameter.
3. Click **Run Tool**.
4. You should see a list of Thai cities in the response:
   ```
   ['Bangkok', 'Chiang Mai', 'Phuket', 'Pattaya', 'Khon Kaen', 'Hat Yai', 'Nakhon Ratchasima', 'Chiang Rai', 'Udon Thani', 'Krabi']
   ```

**Test `get_weather`:**

1. Click on `get_weather`.
2. In the **Arguments** section, enter `Bangkok` for the `city` parameter.
3. Click **Run Tool**.
4. You should see weather information in the response, such as:
   ```
   {'city': 'Bangkok', 'condition': 'Sunny', 'temperature': 28.5, 'humidity': 65.2}
   ```

{: .note }
> The weather data is randomly generated, so the temperature, humidity, and condition values will vary with each call.
