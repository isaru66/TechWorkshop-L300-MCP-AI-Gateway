# Exercise 01: Deploy and configure resources

## Scenario

This training will have you work through building a solution that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Azure API Management as an AI Gateway. The scenario entails creating MCP servers that expose tools and data sources to AI models, and configuring Azure API Management to act as a centralized AI Gateway that manages, secures, and monitors AI API traffic.

In this first exercise, we will set the stage by deploying the Azure resources needed for the solution, including Azure API Management, Azure OpenAI, and the supporting infrastructure for MCP server hosting.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you will be able to:

* Use Azure Developer CLI (azd) to provision Azure resources
* Deploy Azure API Management and configure it as an AI Gateway
* Create resources in Microsoft Foundry and connect Azure resources to an existing project

## Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
