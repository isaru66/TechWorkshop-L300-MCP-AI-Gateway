# Task 03 - Microsoft-provided resources for training

## Introduction

For this workshop, Microsoft provides **limited access** to the following resources during the training session. These resources are pre-provisioned and will be available for the duration of the workshop only.

## What Microsoft provides

![GitHub Copilot Setting](../../media/Solution/0103_Microsoft_Provided_For_Lab.png)

### Azure Subscription

You will receive access to an **Azure Subscription** that allows you to provision and manage Azure services required for the workshop exercises. This includes resources such as:

- Azure API Management
- Azure Functions
- Azure App Service
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Monitor / Application Insights
- And other services used throughout the exercises

### GitHub Copilot Enterprise

You will also receive access to **GitHub Copilot Enterprise (GHE)**, which provides access to advanced AI models to accelerate troubleshooting and development during the training. Available models include GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-5 mini, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and more.

{: .warning }
> These resources are provided for **training purposes only** and have limited access. Do not use them for personal or production workloads. Access will be revoked after the training session ends.

## Success Criteria

- You have created a dedicated browser profile for the training.
- You are signed in to the Azure portal with the provided training account.
- You are signed in to GitHub Enterprise with SSO authentication.
- You have GitHub Copilot Enterprise activated in VS Code.

## Key Tasks

### 01: Create a dedicated browser profile (Recommended)

To avoid conflicts with your existing personal or work accounts, we strongly recommend creating a separate browser profile in Chrome or Edge dedicated to this training.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

#### For Microsoft Edge

1. Open Microsoft Edge.
2. Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner of the browser.
3. Click **Add profile** > **Add**.
4. Choose **Start without your data** and click **Confirm**.
5. A new Edge window will open with a clean profile — use this for all training-related sign-ins.

#### For Google Chrome

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner of the browser.
3. Click **Add** (or **Add another account**).
4. Choose **Continue without an account** (or sign in with the training account if applicable).
5. A new Chrome window will open with a clean profile — use this for all training-related sign-ins.

{: .note }
> Using a dedicated browser profile ensures that your training credentials (Azure, GitHub) do not interfere with your personal or corporate accounts. This prevents session conflicts and unexpected sign-out issues.

</details>

### 02: Sign in to Azure portal

Sign in to the Azure portal using the credentials provided by the instructor.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

1. Open your **dedicated training browser profile**.
2. Navigate to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
3. Enter the **username** and **password** provided by the instructor.
4. Complete multi-factor authentication (MFA) if prompted — you may need the **Microsoft Authenticator** app.
5. Once signed in, verify that you can see the training subscription by navigating to **Subscriptions** in the portal.

{: .note }
> If you are prompted to set up MFA for the first time, follow the on-screen instructions to register the Microsoft Authenticator app with the training account.

</details>

### 03: Sign in to GitHub Enterprise (SSO)

GitHub Copilot Enterprise is provided through a GitHub Enterprise (GHE) organization. You must first authenticate via Single Sign-On (SSO) before you can use GitHub Copilot.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

1. Open your **dedicated training browser profile**.
2. Navigate to [https://github.com](https://github.com).
3. Sign in with the **GitHub account** provided by the instructor (or your own GitHub account if you have been added to the GHE organization).
4. After signing in, you need to **authorize SSO** for the training enterprise:
   - Navigate to [https://github.com/enterprises/isaru66-corp/sso](https://github.com/enterprises/isaru66-corp/sso).
   - Click **Authorize** to complete the SSO authentication.
   - You may be redirected to a Microsoft login page — sign in with the **same training credentials** used for Azure.
5. Once SSO is authorized, verify access by navigating to the training organization's page on GitHub.

{: .note }
> SSO authorization is required because GitHub Copilot Enterprise is managed through a GitHub Enterprise organization. Without completing SSO, you will not have access to GitHub Copilot Enterprise features or the advanced AI models.

### 04: Activate GitHub Copilot Enterprise in VS Code

After signing in to GitHub with SSO, configure VS Code to use GitHub Copilot Enterprise.
