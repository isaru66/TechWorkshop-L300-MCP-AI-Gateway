# Task 01 - Fork and clone the repository

## Introduction

Before setting up your development environment, you need to fork the workshop repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine. Forking the repository allows you to make changes and use GitHub Actions workflows in later exercises.

## Description

In this task, you will fork the workshop repository to your personal GitHub account and clone it to your local machine. If you choose to use a GitHub Codespace instead, you will also create the Codespace in this step.

## Success Criteria

- You have forked the repository to your personal GitHub account.
- You have cloned the forked repository to your local machine, **or** created a GitHub Codespace.

## Learning Resources

- Cloning a repository via the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)
- [GitHub Codespaces overview](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Fork the repository

Fork [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/isaru66/TechWorkshop-L300-MCP-AI-Gateway) to your account. You will need to fork the repo in order to modify and use GitHub Actions workflows in later exercises.

### 02: Clone the repository or create a Codespace

You have two options for setting up your environment:

**Option 1: Clone to your local machine**

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command line or GitHub Desktop. This option requires you to install software locally (covered in the next task).

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TechWorkshop-L300-MCP-AI-Gateway.git
```

Make sure to replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username.

</details>

**Option 2: Use a GitHub Codespace**

If you prefer not to install software locally, you can use a GitHub Codespace. The repository includes a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file that pre-configures the Codespace with all the necessary tools.

Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and select the **Code** button. Then, select the **Codespaces** tab and choose **Create codespace on main**.

The Codespace is pre-configured with the following tools:
- Azure CLI
- Azure Developer CLI (azd)
- Azure Bicep
- Python
- Node.js

And the following VS Code extensions:
- AI Foundry
- Azure Storage
- Bicep
- Azure MCP Server
- Azure Resource Groups
- Python

> You might be unable to perform some activities from a GitHub Codespace. Where possible, prefer working on your local machine for the full experience.
