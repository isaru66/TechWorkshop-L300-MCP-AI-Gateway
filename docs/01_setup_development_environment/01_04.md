# Task 04 - Verify setup and sign in to Azure

## Introduction

Now that you have installed all the necessary software (or set up a GitHub Codespace), the final step is to verify that everything is working correctly and sign in to Azure.

## Description

In this task, you will verify that all required tools are installed and functioning properly. You will also sign in to Azure using the Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI to ensure that you are ready for the remaining exercises.

## Success Criteria

- All required tools are installed and returning the expected version numbers.
- You are signed in to Azure via the Azure CLI.
- You are signed in to Azure via the Azure Developer CLI (azd).

## Learning Resources

- [Sign in with Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference)

## Key Tasks

### 01: Verify installed tools

Run the following commands to confirm that all required tools are installed and accessible from your terminal or Codespace.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

Open a terminal (or the integrated terminal in VS Code / your Codespace) and run each of the following commands:

```bash
# Azure CLI
az --version
```

You should see output indicating Azure CLI version **2.x** or later.

```bash
# Azure Developer CLI
azd version
```

You should see output indicating the azd version.

```bash
# Node.js
node --version
```

You should see a version number of **v20.x.x** or later (v22 recommended).

```bash
# Python
python --version
```

You should see a version number of **3.12.x** or later (3.14 recommended).

```bash
# Git
git --version
```

You should see output indicating git version **2.x** or later.

{: .note }
> If any of the commands above fail or return an unexpected version, revisit the previous task and ensure the corresponding software is installed correctly. On Windows, you may need to restart your terminal or VS Code after installation for the PATH changes to take effect.

### 02: Sign in to Azure CLI

You need to be authenticated with the Azure CLI to deploy and manage resources in later exercises.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

Run the following command to sign in:

```bash
az login
```

A browser window will open prompting you to sign in with your Azure credentials. Complete the sign-in process and return to your terminal.

If you are using a GitHub Codespace or a remote environment without browser access, use the device code flow:

```bash
az login --use-device-code
```

After signing in, verify that you are connected to the correct subscription:

```bash
az account show --output table
```

If you need to switch subscriptions, list all available subscriptions and set the desired one:

```bash
az account list --output table
az account set --subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
```

{: .note }
> If you receive an error message reading, "Your sign-in was successful but does not meet the criteria to access this resource," you are likely using a Microsoft EMU account or some other account that has stringent restrictions. You will need to use an external MCAPS subscription or another paid subscription to continue.

### 03: Sign in to Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The Azure Developer CLI is also used during certain exercises. Sign in to ensure it is ready.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

Run the following command to sign in:

```bash
azd auth login
```

A browser window will open prompting you to sign in. Complete the sign-in process and return to your terminal.

If you are in a remote environment, use:

```bash
azd auth login --use-device-code
```

Verify that you are logged in:

```bash
azd auth login --check-status
```

</details>

### 04: (Optional) Verify Docker installation

If you installed Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop, verify that the Docker engine is running.

<details markdown="block">
<summary><strong>Expand this section to view the solution</strong></summary>

Run the following command:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see output indicating the Docker version. Then verify the engine is running:

```bash
docker info
```

If Docker is not running, start Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop from your applications menu and wait for it to finish starting before retrying the commands.
